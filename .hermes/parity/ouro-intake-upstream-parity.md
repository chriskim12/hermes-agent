# /ouro-intake upstream Ouroboros Interview/Seed parity matrix

Authority: Kanban BO-062 (`t_88ac23f0`)

Goal: port/adapt the necessary upstream `Q00/ouroboros` Interview/Seed behavior into Hermes `/ouro-intake` so it works in the Hermes/Kanban authority model. This is not an “Ouroboros-inspired” checklist.

## Rule

Upstream Interview/Seed behavior is the default. Any difference must be documented as an intentional divergence. Unapproved divergence is a failure.

## Matrix

| ID | Upstream source | Required upstream behavior | Hermes `/ouro-intake` target | Status | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| INT-001 | `skills/interview/SKILL.md` lines 106-119 | Preserve role split: question generator/state, main-session answer router/refiner, human judgment path. | Local controller keeps interview state and explicit refined-answer records; execution authority remains Kanban. | ported | `gateway/ouro_intake.py`, `test_upstream_compound_scope_answer_is_refined_not_collapsed` |
| INT-002 | `skills/interview/SKILL.md` lines 278-330 | Do not compress meaningful answers; preserve structured payload with source prefix semantics. | Store `raw_answer`, `[from-user][refined]`, Decision, Reasoning, Constraints, Out of scope, Codebase context. | ported | `test_upstream_compound_scope_answer_is_refined_not_collapsed` |
| INT-003 | `skills/interview/SKILL.md` lines 331-403 | Free-text answers carrying scope/constraints/decisions require a Refine confirmation gate before being absorbed as ground truth. | Add `refine_pending`; structured payload is confirmed with `승인`/send-as-is before advancing. | ported | `test_upstream_refine_gate_requires_confirmation_for_scope_decision` |
| INT-004 | `skills/interview/SKILL.md` lines 405-410 | Maintain ambiguity/decision ledger across independent tracks. | Keep deterministic ledger and avoid same broad question after responsive answer. | ported | `test_upstream_same_question_not_repeated_after_responsive_answer` |
| INT-005 | `src/ouroboros/bigbang/interview.py` prompt construction path plus `skills/interview/SKILL.md`, `agents/socratic-interviewer.md`, `agents/seed-closer.md` | Question generation and interview UX should use upstream's Interview skill contract as the authority: role split, answer routing, Refine gate, Seed-ready Acceptance Guard, Restate gate, Socratic interviewer constraints, and Seed Closer stop criteria. | BO-062 stores `upstream_question_contract` from the vendored prompt builder on start/answer turns; the contract now embeds the actual vendored upstream interview skill, Socratic interviewer, and Seed Closer assets as `ux_authority=vendored_upstream_interview_skill`. Gateway can render a provider bridge packet, consume explicit overrides, and inject a narrow live Hermes runtime question generator. Successful runtime generation records `upstream_question_provider_call=true` and `upstream_question_adapter=hermes_runtime_question_generator`; failure falls back deterministically without worker/Kanban mutation authority. | adapter_equivalent | `test_bo062_records_vendored_upstream_question_prompt_contract`, `test_bo062_updates_upstream_question_contract_after_answer`, `test_bo062_hermes_generated_question_overrides_gateway_fallback_on_start`, `test_bo062_question_contract_command_renders_provider_bridge_packet_without_calling_provider`, `test_bo062_runtime_question_generator_automatically_replaces_fallback_on_start`, `test_bo062_runtime_question_generator_drives_plain_reply_next_question`, `test_bo062_question_contract_uses_vendored_upstream_interview_skill_as_ux_authority`, `test_bo062_live_runtime_generator_receives_upstream_skill_authority_prompt` |
| INT-006 | `skills/interview/SKILL.md` lines 516-532 | Dialectic Rhythm Guard: avoid too many consecutive non-user answers. | Record `dialectic.non_user_streak`; current Discord intake mostly uses user judgment so streak remains bounded. | ported | `test_intentional_divergences_are_documented` |

| CLOSE-001 | `src/ouroboros/agents/seed-closer.md` lines 11-17 | Low ambiguity is permission to audit closure, not permission to close. | Add Seed Closer audit; material gaps block restate/seed even if score is low. | ported | `test_upstream_seed_closer_blocks_score_only_seed_ready` |

## Intentional divergences

### DIV-001 — No live upstream MCP call in gateway path

- Upstream: `ouroboros_interview` MCP is the preferred question generator/state store.
- Hermes: `/ouro-intake` runs in the gateway and must not introduce execution authority confusion or external MCP availability as a runtime requirement.
- Adaptation: port the behavioral contracts locally and preserve `[from-user][refined]` semantics in durable session state.
- Approval: implicit in Chris's instruction to make it work in our Hermes/Kanban situation while keeping authority local.

### DIV-002 — Seed projected as Kanban admission source material, not execution authority

- Upstream: Seed is the immutable constitution for execution/evaluation.
- Hermes: `upstream_seed` is preserved inside a Kanban admission Seed Contract, while `authority`, `side_effect_boundary`, `initial_routing`, and `approval_required_for` keep execution blocked.
- Approval: explicit user requirement.

### DIV-003 — No gateway restart/live Discord smoke in implementation lane

- Upstream: plugin/runtime sessions see their own changes after restart/session refresh.
- Hermes: source is live-checkout applied only when approved; gateway restart/live smoke are separate gates.
- Approval: standing Hermes gateway boundary.
